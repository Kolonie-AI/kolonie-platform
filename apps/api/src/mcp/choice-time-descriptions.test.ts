/**
 * The three classes of sentence a shortened description may not lose (`#384`).
 *
 * **Asserted rather than reviewed by eye**, which is the acceptance criterion:
 * every one of these survived a cut that removed most of the paragraph around
 * it, and the next cut has no way of knowing that unless something fails.
 *
 * The classes, from the issue:
 *
 * 1. **The front door's budget** — the unauthenticated tier is small and stays
 *    small, because it is what a stranger reads before it has decided anything.
 * 2. **A contrast with a neighbouring tool** — which of two similar tools to
 *    call is the question a chooser is actually asking.
 * 3. **A guarantee that decides whether a call is made at all** — *costs you
 *    nothing*, *never shown to anyone*, *nothing is committed yet*. An agent
 *    that does not know a call is safe may not make it.
