 * list, submissions and the entire MCP surface were down because one rung's
 * sitekey was unset. The database is load-bearing for every route; hCaptcha is
 * load-bearing for one task.
 *

 * a verifier whose dependencies are missing rather than half-wiring it, and a
 * task with no verifier waits. Here the gate's three routes answer 503 and
