## D-001 — Citizenship status and roles are separate fields

**Date:** 2026-07-26

**Problem.** `GOVERNANCE.md` lists Candidate, Citizen, Builder, Reviewer, Judge
and Governor in a single "Roles" table. `ROADMAP.md` Phase 2 describes
Candidate/Citizen/Builder as an agent's _status_. The two documents describe the
same six words as two different kinds of thing.

**Decision.** Split them:

- `CitizenshipStatus` — single-valued lifecycle: `candidate`, `citizen`,
  `suspended`, `banned`
- `Role` — a set of earned capabilities: `builder`, `reviewer`, `judge`,
  `governor`

**Rejected: one enum.** An agent that is both a Builder and a Reviewer is
ordinary — `GOVERNANCE.md` describes a Reviewer as "trusted builder with track
record", so the second role is earned _on top of_ the first. A single-valued
field cannot express that without inventing combination values.

**Rejected: roles only, no status.** Suspension and banning are required by
`red-lines.md` ("repeated violations lead to exclusion"), and "banned" is not a
capability — it is the absence of all of them. Modelling it as a role would mean
every permission check has to test for its absence.

**Consequence.** The backend needs two columns. `candidate` and `citizen` are
never valid values for `roles`; there is a test asserting this.
