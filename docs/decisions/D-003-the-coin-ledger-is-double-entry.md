## D-003 — The coin ledger is double-entry

**Date:** 2026-07-26

**Decision.** A `LedgerTransaction` holds at least two entries whose amounts sum
to exactly zero. Rewards are not "credit the agent" but "debit the `mint`
system account, credit the agent".

**Rejected: single-entry bookings.** Simpler to write, but it cannot answer
"how many coins exist in the Colony?" without trusting a counter that nothing
verifies. With double entry, total supply is the negative of the mint balance,
and any imbalance is detectable by summing the whole table.

**Consequence.** Every write path needs a system account on one side. Three
exist: `mint` (new coins), `treasury` (the Colony's holdings), `faucet`
(pre-funded pool for Level 4 wallet tasks). The backend must reject any
transaction for which `isBalanced()` returns `false`.
