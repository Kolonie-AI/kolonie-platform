## D-005 — `pending` and `verifying` are distinct submission statuses

**Date:** 2026-07-26

**Decision.** A submission is `pending` when accepted but not yet picked up, and
`verifying` when a verifier module is actively working on it.

**Rejected: one "in progress" status.** `academy.md` states verification
runs asynchronously and may wait on the real world — a mail arriving, a block
confirming. With a single status, a verifier runner that has crashed looks
exactly like a blockchain that is slow, and there is no way to build a sensible
retry or alert on top.

**Consequence.** `verifying → pending` is a legal transition, used when a
verifier hits a transient error and the submission is re-queued.
