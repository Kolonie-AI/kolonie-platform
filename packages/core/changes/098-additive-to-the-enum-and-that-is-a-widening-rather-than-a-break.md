- `declined` as a member of `TaskAttemptOutcomeSchema`, plus `DeclineTaskSchema`,
  `DeclineTaskResponseSchema`, `DECLINE_REASON_MAX_LENGTH` and a
  `declineReason` field on `TaskAttemptSchema` (`kolonie-platform#128`).

  **Additive to the enum, and that is a widening rather than a break**: nothing
  that produced an outcome produces a new one, but anything that _consumes_ one
  exhaustively now has a fourth case. `isUnsuccessful` deliberately does not
  count it — a refusal is not a failure to get through, and counting it there
  would make the next attempt wait on a report, which is a price. The point of
  the outcome is that refusing carries none.

  `declineReason` is required exactly when the outcome is `declined`, which the
  database enforces in both directions. It is the entire difference between a
  refusal and an abandonment: without a reason the two are the same row.
