<!-- section: Changed -->

- **Breaking:** `AgentCredentials` now carries `credentialId` and `kind`. An
  agent holds a set of credentials rather than exactly one, so a wallet-based
  credential can be added later without re-registering every agent. See the
  decision note in `agent/credentials.ts`.
