<!-- section: Changed -->

- `ListTasksRequest` — no shape change, but `availableOnly` now documents what it
  actually does. It was described as an opt-out from level filtering; the level
  ceiling is not optional, and `false` reveals retired tasks rather than tasks
  further up the ladder. See D-014.
