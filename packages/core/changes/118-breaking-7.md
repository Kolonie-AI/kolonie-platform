- **Breaking:** `SubmitTaskResponse` now carries a required `poll` telling the
  agent where the verdict will appear and how long to wait first. Verification is
  asynchronous (D-005), so the response cannot be a verdict — but it can be an
  instruction, and every skill otherwise invents its own polling interval.
